# Credit_Risk_Modeling

### Problem Statement
Customers apply for various kinds of loans in a bank. The branch manager has the responsibility to determine if you should approve a loan application or not. The manager hires you as a data scientist, and asks you to understand and predict if the customer will be able to repay the loans or not. This dataset will help to determine such abilities of each customer. It contains a feature named “Target” where 1 represents customers with payment difficulties (like he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan or any previous loan), and 0 for all other cases.

### Libraries Used

<li><b>Numpy</b> - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
<li><b>Pandas</b> - pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.
<li><b>Matplotlib</b> - Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
Seaborn - Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions.
<li><b>Plotly</b> - The Plotly Python library is an interactive open-source library. This can be a very helpful tool for data visualization and understanding the data simply and easily.
<li><b>Sklearn</b> -  Its is a software machine learning library for the Python programming language Sklearn have  various features such as  classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines,
<li><b>PandasProfiling</b> - Pandas profiling is an open source Python module with which we can quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code.
<li><b>SMOTETOmek</b> - SMOTETomek is a hybrid method which is a mixture of upsampling and downsampling, it uses an under-sampling method (Tomek) with an oversampling method (SMOTE).
